# Step by Step process 
1. Calculate th mean of all features
2. Construct the mean centering matrix
3. Compute Covariance matrix
4. Extract eigenvalues and eigenvectors
5. Sort eigenvectors by descending eigenvalues.
6. Select top k components based on explained variance
7. Project data to this new k-dimensional space.
